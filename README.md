# Simple Linear Regression Model: Train/Test Split Method
A linear model that accurately picks the best independent variable to predict vehicle CO2 emissions.

# Installation Instructions
Download both the .py and .csv files and place them in the same directory on the PC. Run the code from your IDE of choice.

It is recommended that this python script be ran in Sublime Text 3.2.2. 

# Description
This python script illustrates how to use linear regression models to determine linear relationships between two variables. To illustrate this, new vehicle data was used from the Natural Resources Canada website (https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/). This website provides .csv files of new vehicle information for a variety of model years. In this case, data collected for 2021 model year vehicles was used. 

Once the .csv file has been downloaded and placed in the same directory as the .py file, the code can be ran to produce graphs. 

The python script will first produce a histogram of the entire data set for the user to see. This part of the code acts as a visual aid to help the user visualize the entire data set more easily.
